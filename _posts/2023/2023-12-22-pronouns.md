Adapted from a workplace session on pronouns and trans identity.

**Still a work in progress**

## What are pronouns? 
and for that matter, what's gender?

### Pronouns

- Words used in place of nouns
- English has 1st (I, we), 2nd (you), and 3rd (he, she, they, it) person pronouns
  - When we talk about pronouns in the context of gender identity, we’re referring to 3rd person pronouns – words you use to talk about someone to another person
- In English as well as some other languages, pronouns are gendered

### Ok, what's gender?

- One way we classify humans
- Ostensibly related to biology, but mostly tied into gendered social norms

> *Gender* literally means “kind” or “type” or “classification” – it’s related to words like *genre* and *general* – and has no necessary connection to real-world biology.

## A brief foray into history
this is all new, right? ...right?

### Fuss over pronouns isn't new

> In 1916, when Jeanette Rankin, of Montana, became the first woman elected to the US House of Representatives, the *Minneapolis Star Tribune* ran this headline challenging the grammatical rule that says the masculine pronoun [he] can refer to women: “Can ‘She’ Be ‘He’, a Congressman, and Be Woman?” Pronouns aren’t just a part of speech. Pronouns are political.

### Alternate pronouns aren't new

> ...Francis Brewster coined *E*, *es*, and *em* in 1841, and Charles Crozat Converse announced *thon* and *thons* in 1884...
> ...*ze* appears in 1864, introduced by someone known only by the initials J.W.L., and *hir* first popped up a century ago, invented, or at least introduced to readers in California, by the editor of the Sacramento Bee on August 14, 1920.

### Trans and nonbinary people aren't new

> In 1841, Francis Brewster took time from his medical practice to write a grammar in which he labeled his new pronouns “masculor feminine.” *Masculofeminina* is Latin for “man-woman, or hermaphrodite,” and Brewster’s use of this unusual term is the first hint at nonbinary gender in a grammar book.

- Magnus Hirschfeld (1868 – 1935) was a German physician and sexologist credited with coining the term transvestite to describe people we would today likely consider transgender
- Hirschfeld’s Institute for Sexual Research, opened in 1919 in Berlin, performed the first modern gender affirmation surgeries in 1930

### History repeats itself

- Hirschfeld’s Institute was an early target of Nazi book burnings

> Men seemed eager to blame women for the pronoun problem. If finding a new pronoun was the *job* of the women’s movement, then singular *they* was the *fault* of the women’s movement.

## Prescriptivism and descriptivism

- Language is built by and for us, to serve our needs
- It has evolved to get to where we are now, and will continue to evolve
  - *thou* used to be a singular *you*, which was plural-only
- Corporate environments are great examples of constantly shifting language – especially around our acronyms

> Calling words “invented” makes them sound artificial. But word coining is a natural process, one that’s essential for any language to survive.

## Pronoun interactions
...and how do I help?

### Introductions

- Introduce yourself with pronouns to set norms
- Encourage, but don’t force, others to do the same
- Don’t single out the visibly trans person!

### Corrections

#### Correcting yourself

- Repeat what you were saying with the correct pronoun
- Respond with “thank you” to others’ corrections
- Move on! Don’t make a big deal of it

#### Correcting others

- *Gently* interject with the proper pronoun
- Talk to the speaker afterwards about their mistake – no shaming!
- Check in with the person who was misgendered

### Digital tools

- Set your pronouns in Teams
- Add pronouns to your email signature

### ***PRACTICE!***

- Deliberately think or speak about a specific person using the correct pronouns
- Use practice passages such as [Alice in Wonderland Texts | Gender Neutral Pronoun Blog (wordpress.com)](https://genderneutralpronoun.wordpress.com/about/alice/)
- Correcting others is actually great practice – it helps you be more aware of pronouns in speech
- The key to success will be repetition and reinforcement

> It is not unusual for speakers of English to find it difficult to switch pronouns about a person, because we (English-speakers) don’t have that many pronouns, historically, and we tend not to introduce new ones quite as often as we introduce, say, nouns.

## More scenarios
beyond just "they"

### Multiple pronouns

- Some people use multiple sets of pronouns
- For some, there’s a preference; others like all offered sets equally
  - Ask if you aren’t certain!
- Using both/all sets offered at varying times can make the person feel seen
- Don’t feel you need to alternate within one sentence or context – this can be confusing for you and others

### Neopronouns

- Some people use pronouns other than he, she, they, or it
- Because these pronouns are newer to the English language, they are termed “neopronouns”
- Examples:
  - Ze/hir/hirs or ze/zir/zirs
  - Xe/xem/xyrs (or various other spellings)
  - E/em/es or ey/em/eirs

### Any/all pronouns

- Some people accept any pronouns for various reasons
- This is not an opportunity to ask them which ones they “really prefer”
