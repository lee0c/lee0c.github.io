Adapted from a workplace session on pronouns and gender identity.

## What are pronouns? 
and for that matter, what's gender?

### Pronouns

- Words used in place of nouns
- English has 1st (I, we), 2nd (you), and 3rd (he, she, they, it) person pronouns
  - When we talk about pronouns in the context of gender identity, we’re referring to **3rd person pronouns** – words you use to talk about someone to another person
  - It is still always correct to use you/yours (2nd person) pronouns

### Ok, what's gender?

- In English as well as some other languages, pronouns are *gendered*
- One way we classify humans
- Ostensibly related to biology, but mostly tied into gendered social norms

> *Gender* is derived from the Latin work *genus*, meaning “kind” or “type.” Gender is the social organization of bodies into different categories of people. In the contemporary United States, this sorting into categories is based on sex, but historically and cross-culturally there have been many different social systems of organizing people into genders.

– Transgender History: the Roots of Today’s Revolution, Susan Stryker (she/her)

> *Gender* literally means “kind” or “type” or “classification” – it’s related to words like *genre* and *general* – and has no necessary connection to real-world biology.

– What’s Your Pronoun: Beyond He & She, Dennis Baron (he/him)

### Gender terms

- **Cisgender**: someone who is the gender assigned to them at birth
- **Transgender**: someone who is a gender other than, or in addition to, the gender assigned to them at birth
- **Nonbinary**: an umbrella term or individual identity for anyone whose gender does not wholly and solely align with one binary gender
  - **Genderfluid** and **agender** are several common nonbinary identities
- **Two-spirit**: an umbrella term for Indigenous people who fulfill traditional third-gender roles

## A brief foray into history
this is all new, right? ...right?

### Alternate pronouns aren't new

> ...Francis Brewster coined *E*, *es*, and *em* in 1841, and Charles Crozat Converse announced *thon* and *thons* in 1884...

> ...*ze* appears in 1864, introduced by someone known only by the initials J.W.L., and *hir* first popped up a century ago, invented, or at least introduced to readers in California, by the editor of the Sacramento Bee on August 14, 1920.

### Fuss over pronouns isn't new

> In 1916, when Jeanette Rankin, of Montana, became the first woman elected to the US House of Representatives, the *Minneapolis Star Tribune* ran this headline challenging the grammatical rule that says the masculine pronoun [he] can refer to women: “Can ‘She’ Be ‘He’, a Congressman, and Be Woman?” Pronouns aren’t just a part of speech. Pronouns are political.

### Trans and nonbinary people aren't new

> In 1841, Francis Brewster took time from his medical practice to write a grammar in which he labeled his new pronouns “masculor feminine.” *Masculofeminina* is Latin for “man-woman, or hermaphrodite,” and Brewster’s use of this unusual term is the first hint at nonbinary gender in a grammar book.

- Magnus Hirschfeld (1868 – 1935) was a German physician and sexologist credited with coining the term transvestite to describe people we would today likely consider transgender
- Hirschfeld’s Institute for Sexual Research, opened in 1919 in Berlin, performed the first modern gender affirmation surgeries in 1930

### History repeats itself

- Hirschfeld’s Institute was an early target of Nazi book burnings

> Men seemed eager to blame women for the pronoun problem. If finding a new pronoun was the *job* of the women’s movement, then singular *they* was the *fault* of the women’s movement.

## Prescriptivism and descriptivism

- Prescriptivism handles language from a top-down standpoint: it is defined by an authority, and we use it as defined
- Descriptivism recognizes that we build our own language, and that authorities (like dictionaries) are just documenting its use
- Language is built by and for us, to serve our needs
- It has evolved to get to where we are now, and will continue to evolve
  - *thou* used to be a singular *you*, which was plural-only
- Corporate environments are great examples of constantly shifting language – especially around our acronyms

> Calling words “invented” makes them sound artificial. But word coining is a natural process, one that’s essential for any language to survive.

– What’s Your Pronoun: Beyond He & She, Dennis Baron (he/him)

### Why it matters

> …the use of appropriate pronouns has a positive impact on mental health, and the use of inappropriate pronouns can form part of a general pattern of harassment and abuse.

– What’s Your Pronoun: Beyond He & She, Dennis Baron (he/him)

> Gender is a story, not just a word. There are as many ways to be a woman as there are women. There are as many ways to be a man as there are men. There are as many ways to be non-binary as there are non-binary people. This complexity is not chaos, it just is. We do not need to be universal to be valid.

– Beyond the Gender Binary, Alok Vaid-Menon (they/them)

- Misgendering is generally part of a larger pattern
- Even if misgendering isn’t coming from a place of ill intent, consistent misgendering builds up to be very detrimental
- Referring to people correctly shows respect and understanding - just like learning to pronounce an unfamiliar name
- Nonbinary is not a monolith. No gender (experience, expression) is a monolith
- Pronouns are just one small part of a much larger picture

## Pronoun interactions
...and how do I help?

### Introductions

- Introduce yourself with pronouns to set norms
- Encourage, *but don’t force*, others to do the same
- **Don’t single out the visibly trans person!**

### Corrections

#### Correcting yourself

- Repeat what you were saying with the correct pronoun
- Respond with “thank you” to others’ corrections
- Move on! Don’t make a big deal of it

#### Correcting others

- *Gently* interject with the proper pronoun
- Talk to the speaker afterwards about their mistake – no shaming!
- Check in with the person who was misgendered

### Digital tools

- Set your pronouns in Teams
- Add pronouns to your email signature

### ***PRACTICE!***

- Deliberately think or speak about a specific person using the correct pronouns
- Use practice passages such as [Alice in Wonderland Texts - Gender Neutral Pronoun Blog](https://genderneutralpronoun.wordpress.com/about/alice/)
- Correcting others is actually great practice – it helps you be more aware of pronouns in speech
- The key to success will be repetition and reinforcement

> It is not unusual for speakers of English to find it difficult to switch pronouns about a person, because we (English-speakers) don’t have that many pronouns, historically, and we tend not to introduce new ones quite as often as we introduce, say, nouns.

## More scenarios
beyond just "they"

### What if you don't know someone's pronouns?

- Use they/them/theirs - this is language you already use! e.g. "Someone left their phone here"
  - Note that if you *know* someone doesn't use they/them, this is misgendering - "they" is not always neutral
- Use the person’s name

### Multiple pronouns

- Some people use multiple sets of pronouns
- For some, there’s a preference; others like all offered sets equally
  - Ask if you aren’t certain!
- Using both/all sets offered at varying times can make the person feel seen
  - Don’t feel you need to alternate within one sentence or context – this can be confusing for you and others

### Neopronouns

- Some people use pronouns other than he, she, they, or it
- Because these pronouns are newer to the English language, they are termed “neopronouns”
- Examples:
  - Ze/hir/hirs or ze/zir/zirs
  - Xe/xem/xyrs (or various other spellings)
  - Ey/em/eirs

### Any/all pronouns

- Some people accept any pronouns for various reasons
- **This is not an opportunity to ask them which ones they "really prefer"**
