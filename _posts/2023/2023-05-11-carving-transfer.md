## materials

### for transfer

- [speedy-carve](https://www.dickblick.com/products/speedball-speedy-carve-blocks/){:target="_blank"}
  - I have since also used [moo carve](https://www.dickblick.com/products/moo-carve-professional-carving-blocks/){:target="_blank"} and been successful
- laserjet printed or xerox'd image, preferably something with high contrast
- acrylic gel medium - I use [Golden Soft Gel Matte](https://www.dickblick.com/items/golden-soft-acrylic-gel-medium-matte-16-oz-jar/){:target="_blank"}
- paintbrush
- [brayer](https://www.dickblick.com/products/testrite-foam-brayer/){:target="_blank"}

### for carving

- carving tool(s) such as [speedball carving tool](https://www.dickblick.com/products/speedball-linoleum-cutters/){:target="_blank"} or [flexcut carving tools](https://www.dickblick.com/products/flexcut-lino-relief-printmaking-set/){:target="_blank"}
  - I use a narrow V tool from flexcut and large/small U tools from speedball at current

### for printing

- my favorite stamping ink at current is [VersaFine](https://www.tsukineko.co.jp/english/detail/versafine/index.html){:target="_blank"}
- (edit 18 Sep 2023) I have since used [Speedball fabric block printink inks](https://www.dickblick.com/products/speedball-fabric-paper-block-printing-ink/){:target="_blank"}. Preferable for fabric.

## process

1. Cut printout and speedy-carve to desired overall shape
1. Paint an even layer of gel medium on both printout (inked side) and speedy-carve
1. Align the gel'd printout to the gel'd block, and press on using a brayer
1. Let dry. Really. Let it dry. Leave it be.
1. Dampen the back of the printout with a sponge or wet finger, then gently rub to remove paper
1. Done correctly, this should leave your image (and a thin layer of gel medium) on the speedy-carve
