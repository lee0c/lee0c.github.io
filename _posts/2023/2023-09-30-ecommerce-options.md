## [Artisans Cooperative](https://artisans.coop/pages/seller-profile/riverside-refuge-studio){:target="_blank"}

- using this. clunky. variants are unintuitive.
- allows me to set alt text for images.
- points for being a cooperative model

## bigCartel

## Etsy

- fuck etsy mxn

## [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/inherentlee){:target="_blank"}

- using this currently, but it has a strict no-NSFW policy.

## nopCommerce

- open source! hosting is a bit of a pain
- has an Azure hosting option that was easy enough to spin up

## PrestaShop

- open source! hosting is a bit of a pain

## Shopify

- $30/month minimum after a few free months.

## [Square](https://riverside-refuge.square.site/){:target="_blank"}

- this is my current preference.
- has a free tier! pay per transaction rather than monthly.
- only irritation point so far: managing shipping myself actually costs me money? there's a fee for *not* using Square's integrated shipping.
- does not support alt text for background images or product images, which, wtf
- keyboard navigation of the main menu fails when there are nested categories below any menu item - focus lands on each category without expanding the menu item
- support blows
- legal name only policy apparently which ewwwww

## WooCommerce

- WordPress only.
