My second pair of socks, knit for my partner. They use [Schoppel-Wolle](https://www.schoppel-wolle.de/) Das Paar yarn in the colorway Fruhjahrsputz / Spring Cleaning. This yarn is designed to produce identical striping for each sock, and it very nearly did, with only a tiny discrepancy notable as I got to the toes.
