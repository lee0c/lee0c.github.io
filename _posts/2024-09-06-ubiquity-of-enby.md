according to [gender census](https://www.gendercensus.com){:target="_blank"}, which surveys "people whose genders are not adequately described, expressed or encompassed by the restrictive gender binary":

- ~64% of respondents use the term "nonbinary"
- ~32% of respondents use the term "enby"

source: [gender census - identity words](https://www.gendercensus.com/results/2023-worldwide/#identity-words){:target="_blank"} (this was a "choose all that apply" question, not "either/or")

we don't know the overlap - it could be that half of nonbinary people also use enby, or that bunches of people use enby who don't call themselves nonbinary

either way, there's a big chunk of nonbinary folks who don't call themselves enby - at least half of us

**if you're talking about the entire community or the gender category:** please consider just saying nonbinary
