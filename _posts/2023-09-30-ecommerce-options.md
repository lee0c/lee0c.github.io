## Artisans Cooperative

using this. clunky. variants are unintuitive.

allows me to set alt text for images.

## Etsy

fuck etsy mxn

## Kofi

using this currently, but it has a strict no-NSFW policy.

## nopCommerce

open source! hosting is a bit of a pain

## PrestaShop

open source! hosting is a bit of a pain

## Shopify

$30/month minimum after a few free months.

## Square

this is my current preference.

has a free tier! pay per transaction rather than monthly.

only irritation point so far: managing shipping myself actually costs me money? there's a fee for *not* using Square's integrated shipping.

does not support alt text

## WooCommerce

WordPress only.
