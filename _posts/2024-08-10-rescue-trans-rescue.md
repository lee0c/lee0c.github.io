### What type of art?

All mediums. Content restrictions may be imposed at Trans Rescue’s discretion (will talk to them about this). Physical and digital are both allowed (digital will be displayed in the exhibit with a watermark). Art can range from “fine art” to “craft” to “merch” as long as it is your artistic creation.

Special focus on a planned collaborative sticker sheet as a major small-dollar item. Ideally *all* artists contribute to this and it includes the Trans Rescue logo.

### Must it be created for this exhibit?

I am open to opinions here. My current thoughts are: no, but it’s preferred that it is. If we have so many submissions such as to make this logistically perilous and I have to impose submission limits, reused existing work may be cut. However, I don’t currently expect to reach those limits.

### Is there a theme?

TBD. Will talk to TR about this and come back to you.

### Who are the artists?

Trans and gender expansive/diverse people who wish to help. If you are unsure whether this includes you: it does.

### How many works per artist?

I am open to opinions here. My current thoughts are:

one of:

- 1 original work (this may mean a single item, or for something like a print, it may mean a set of similar items) that is able to be digitally included on the sticker sheet as well as sold on its own.
- 1 original work (single item or set of prints etc) that cannot easily be included on the sticker sheet PLUS 1 small digital design for sticker sheet inclusion.

I want to expand on the “single item or set” thing - this lets different types of crafts shine differently and allows us to price things reasonably and at many price points. It also means not everything will be one-and-gone!

### How is pricing determined? Are artists paid?

This is *very* tentative at current, but here’s my thoughts:

For an original work, artists set the following:

1. Inventory: number of pieces of the work
2. Base price: starting price of the work
3. Commission: % of the base price they would like to take home, up to 50% inclusive.
4. Shipping: shipping fees grouped by regional categories (yes I will lay this out clearer)

Artists will therefore at a minimum take home (Base price * Commission + Shipping) * Sold Inventory. This gives them the ability to ensure they are paid what they consider adequate for charity work.

---

For any item in the exhibit, a buyer may choose to pay beyond base price. **Decision point**: I am uncertain whether this should be considered a flat donation to TR on top, or whether the artist’s commission should apply to this too. Prospective artists please give me your thoughts!!

---

On further reflection: I am leaning towards artist’s commission applying to any overhead pay on a piece of art.

Here’s why:

Anyone is able to make a donation to the fundraiser without buying art. By buying art and paying additional, the buyer credits the artist as well as the fundraiser, and this should be reflected financially.

potential logistical downside of this: buying multiple works may require separate orders. I think I will be setting this up in jotform, so I’ll see what I can finagle.

Let’s further elucidate this pricing schema with examples.

(Also, look, there will technically be little nickel-and-dime platform fees that chip in to the math here. I’m…not doing that yet, please.)

#### Example: Alyx

Alyx creates a painting. Xe decides that xe would like to recoup materials cost and donate labor. Xe sets xyr inventory at 1, base price at $100, commission at 15%, and shipping at $20 (there will be regional categories for shipping. it’s not relevant here so ignore it).

Alyx’s painting might be bought for its base price + shipping ($120) in which case xe would get $100 \* .15 + $20 = $35. Or maybe xyr painting is bought for a bit above its base price, $130 + $20 shipping = $150. In this case, Alyx would get $130 \* .15 + $20 = $39.50.

(In these cases, TR makes $85 and $110.50 respectively.)

#### Example: Babs

Babs creates a series of tooled leather keychains. She can’t afford to donate much. She sets an inventory of 4, a base price of $20, a commission of 50%, and a shipping price of $10.

If all of Babs’ keychains sell, she will be compensated, at a minimum, ($20 \* .50 + $10) \* 4 = $80, half of which covers shipping and half of which is commission. If some of her keychains sell for elevated prices — let’s say they sell for $25, $40, $20, and $30 — she will be compensated, forgive my incorrect math notation but hopefully it gets the point across without being exhaustingly long… sum of ([$25, $40, $20, $30] \* .50 + $10) = $97.50, $40 of which is shipping.

(In these cases, TR makes $40 and $57.50 respectively.)

(Also, if any keychains don’t sell, Babs retains the keychain and can resell to anyone she desires.)

#### Example: Coral

Coral creates a phone wallpaper with their digital art. They don’t care if they receive anything for this, and they want their item to be accessible and for everyone. They set their inventory at 50, their base price at $5, their commission at 0%, and their shipping at $0 (digital purchase).

Regardless of how many sell, Coral doesn’t get anything but satisfaction of helping. (And exposure, but like, don’t work for exposure kids.)

(In this case, TR gets $5 \* # sold.)

(Coral retains the rights to their digital art and can continue to resell and reproduce it after the exhibit — this goes for physical reproducible art as well).

### How is fulfillment handled?

Individual artists are responsible for their work’s fulfillment. After an order, relevant buyer details (address/phone/email, or just email for digital) will be forwarded to the relevant artist(s).

Yes, this means if you buy items from multiple artists you will pay multiple shipping fees. That’s just the way it’s gonna be. I don’t want all of this stuff in my living room.

Missing or damaged items will be dealt with case-by-case with best effort, but this is a fundraiser so do be kind about it. Let’s hope we don’t see much of that.

Returns are not a thing.

#### If shipping is per-item, why bother having it listed as shipping? Just bundle it.

Clarity of information. Helps you understand where your money’s going. Also, I want to encourage artists to actively plan for all shipping eventualities and think through what they want to offer.

### DEADLINE???

That’s the best question you got, I’ll give ya that.

I want to balance speed for TR’s sake while giving space for artists to work.

I am undecided and would love input from prospective artists.

Here’s three general options (none pinned to dates yet, these are *styles* of timing):

- **Straightforward.** Exhibit starts day A and ends day Z. Artists must have work in for day A.
- **Staged - my preference at current.** Exhibit has multiple starts days A, J, and R and ends day Z. Artists may choose the deadline that best works for them with the understanding that a later deadline leaves them less exhibition time.
- **Rolling.** Exhibit is ongoing days A through Z and accepts art up through day R or so. This would likely prove challenging/exhausting to advertise effectively since new works would roll out whenever.

### I’m not an artist but I want to help!

You can always buy from the exhibit and donate, or…

Help out!! Here’s some actions, ranging in skills required, level of effort, and level of interaction with me.

- Boost posts.
- Talk up the event to friends.
- Write your own posts with the hashtag - one loner shouting gets nothing trending.
- Potentially help me work with Trans Rescue to design promotional material.
- Work with me to create a website - this leans heavily on *your* skills, not mine :/
- Work with me to design “logistics” - software/apps, data flow, etc
- Work with me and the artists to lay out a sticker sheet
- Work with me to help support artists and buyers with questions over email or fedi.
