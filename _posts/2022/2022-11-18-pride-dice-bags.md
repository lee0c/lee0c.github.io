    alt: "Several knitted drawstring dice bags sit in front of a bookshelf. They are in different pride flag colors; from right to left (skipping a few duplicates) bisexual, lesbian, nonbinary, trans, and genderqueer. The trans-colored dice bag in the center opens towards the camera, showing a variety of colorful dice inside."

Knitted dice bags in pride flag patterns.

Available flags at current:

- bisexual
- lesbian
- nonbinary
- transgender
- genderqueer
- genderfluid
- pansexual
- 6-stripe rainbow

I also have several varieties of rainbow gradient yarn which will produce varying results.

For any flag not on the list, please do still message - I'm happy to get the colors missing to do it! For example I would only need a gray for asexual, so it's easy to add :)

## details

### dimensions

usually sized to hold 1-3 dice sets, but I can aim for a specific size on request.
