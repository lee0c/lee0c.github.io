## materials

- bella & canvas tee shirts (light tones, standard fabrics - no fleece, suede, ribbing, etc)
- cutproof mat (optional, can be subbed out for any firm surface to slide into the shirt)
- water-soluble pencil for fabric marking
- versaFine ink pads
- brayer

## steps

1. iron front of shirt lightly to remove any wrinkles
1. lay shirt out on table. I put a cutproof mat inside the shirt to prevent any ink from going through and give myself a firm surface to work on
1. for a multi-layer design:
  1. line up an un-inked stamp, face up
  1. with water soluble pencil, outline 1 corner and mark out at least one other alignment spot. I found I could make marks about an inch long and get decent alignment just from that, rather than outlining the whole stamp (which ime gets similar alignment)
1. ink stamp thoroughly (lay stamp faceup and daub with ink pads)
1. lay stamp into position (for multi-layer design, align with existing marks)
1. press across the stamp with the brayer, being careful not to move the stamp
1. lift up in a clean motion; I generally lift a corner and check that things are looking good before lifting fully off
1. hang or drape until ready to iron
  - do **not** stack the shirts, even if the ink seems dry! it will transfer to other shirts
  - do not let the shirts sit in any way that the design is in contact with other fabric
1. press with iron on the highest appropriate heat setting
  - avoid moving the iron a lot as this can smudge ink
  - my rule of thumb has been to press until the image is uniformly hot to the touch
  - I am going to try next time to use parchment paper to avoid any ink smudginess (Edit: meh, I don't really recommend it. Just hold the iron still at first.)
1. dab some water on the water-soluble pencil and rub gently to erase

## other notes

- *clean hands.* **clean hands.** very important.
