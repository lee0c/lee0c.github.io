This site is based on [Millennial](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/){:target="_blank"}, a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a blog or publication by Paul Le.

The font is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont), specifically designed for low-vision readers to improve character recognition.

Thank you to some lovely friends for their feedback and help with the site! You should hire them. Yes, you.
