## commissions

A print design based on a photograph can take 1-4 hours to create and another 2-6 hours to carve, based on size and complexity.

A logo or ex libris stamp depends on if you have an existing design and want it carved or not. I can design it for you otherwise, which takes a variable amount of time, but carving is usually quick as these tend to be smaller.
