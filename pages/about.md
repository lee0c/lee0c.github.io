My name is Lee Cattarin. I use he or ze pronouns, or 
<a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@lee.cattarin" target="_blank">most neopronouns</a>.

I'm a programmer (backend, K8s/devOps), crafter - knitting, spinning yarn, stamp carving/printmaking, cardmaking & papercrafts, and lately playing w/ bookbinding - and occasional artist, bread baker, guitar player, and probably a lot of other things.
