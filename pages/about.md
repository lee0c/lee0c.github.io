My name is Lee Cattarin. I use he or ze pronouns, or [most neopronouns](https://en.pronouns.page/@lee.cattarin){:target="_blank"}. Just have fun.

I'm a programmer (backend, K8s/devOps, learning about accessibility), crafter - knitting, spinning yarn, stamp carving/printmaking, cardmaking & papercrafts, bookbinding, and lately playing w/ leatherworking - and artist, bread baker, guitar player, and probably a lot of other things.

![A koi pond in fall afternoon light. A person in a knitted dark teal sweater crouches in front of the pond and extends hir hand towards the surface of the water. Several curious koi are arriving to see what the matter is, and one white koi has stuck its face a bit out of the water to reach toward hir hand.](assets/img/koi-pond.jpg)
