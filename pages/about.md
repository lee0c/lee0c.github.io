My name is Lee Cattarin. I use he or ze pronouns, or [most neopronouns](https://en.pronouns.page/@lee.cattarin){:target="_blank"}. Just have fun.

I'm a programmer (backend, K8s/devOps, learning about accessibility), artist&crafter - knitting, spinning yarn, stamp carving/printmaking, cardmaking & papercrafts, bookbinding, and lately playing w/ leatherworking - and bread baker, guitar player, and probably a lot of other things.

As of November 2023, my wife Brooke Osment and I have a business: Riverside Refuge Studio. You can find various store links, or other ways to connect, on my [contact page](contact). We're based out of Vashon, WA, USA, and ship worldwide.

Several curious koi are arriving to see what the matter is, and one white koi has stuck its face a bit out of the water to reach toward hir hand.](assets/img/koi-pond.jpg)
