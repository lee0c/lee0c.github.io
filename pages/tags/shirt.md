hand-printed designs on [bella & canvas](https://shop.bellacanvas.com/) shirts. To order, pick a shirt (I recommend shopping the sale section!) in a light or neutral tone - please be cognizant of the colors of the design you'd like when picking the shirt color - and a simple fabric (no fleece, suede, or ribbed fabrics). Send me a link to it and let me know which design you'd like, and I'll get it printed and ship it your way.

> Note: Shirt orders are done in rounds so I can take advantage of free shipping. This means if there's no demand, your shirt may wait a while. If you'd really like to get around this, I'll just ask that you cover the additional shipping.
