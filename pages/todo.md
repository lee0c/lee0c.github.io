- friend suggestions
  - ~~next and previous are swapped from standard~~
  - ~~inactive pagination buttons are hard to read~~
  - maybe include the "how to order" section from the FAQ on the bottom of each item (I was confused trying to figure out how the shop worked until I found the FAQ)
  - it's not totally clear to me what's a project and what's an item available to order, different templates might help --> make categories way more transparent
- resize photos to more web-friendly sizes
- ~~what's up with the domain messing w/ CSS huh?~~
- HTTPS properly configured
- ~~correct domain for full site~~
- ~~opacity for "featured post" items~~
- fuxk w/ code syntax css :grimace:
- ~~maybe condense to a contact page?~~
- add more projects
  - ~~socks~~
  - knitting highlights
  - leather keychains?
  - trans rights skeleton (pronoun patches have a post but just "trans rights!" patch does not)
- friend suggestions re a11y
  - ~~h3 in header should be h1~~
  - ~~change nav bar to an unordered list [ref](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/)~~
  - ~~art pages need structural help to be screen reader friendly - heading is nested fairly far down and link needs aria-label~~
  - ~~add aria-label to next/prev~~
  - text should always be in a `<p>` or `<h#>` - `<span>` is meaningless to screenreaders
    - ~~does this include things like pagination buttons?~~
- make categories way more transparent!!
- charity recommendations for donate-what-you-want
- ~~color options for patches/prints~~
- ~~3 categories for art items~~
    - ~~project gallery (unavailable finished items)~~
    - ~~ready to ship (available finished items)~~
    - ~~on demand (available made-on-demand items)~~
