- ~~add tags~~
- add `aria-current` to indicate active page
- ~~put dropdown in nav~~
- list-style: none might break some screen readers? investigate
- ~~better contrast for highlighted items in hamburger menu~~
- ~~remove underlines on next/prev buttons~~
- ~~fix hamburger menu for smaller screens - should open on `enter` or `space`~~
  - now just opens when there's focus on the icon, which maybe isn't ideal?
  - it would be better to make it opt-in

  - ~~h3 in header should be h1~~
  - ~~change nav bar to an unordered list [ref](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/structure/)~~
  - ~~art pages need structural help to be screen reader friendly - heading is nested fairly far down and link needs aria-label~~
