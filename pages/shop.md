## quick guide

- **ready to ship:** available unique finished items
- **on demand:** available made-on-demand items
- **gallery:** unavailable finished items

## payment?

optional! Any items up for grabs operate on an honor system donate-what-you-want/pay-what-you-want model - if you would like to pay for any gifts I send out, I recommend you divert it to a charitable org you care about or to mutual aid. I have the beginnings of a [list of charities](give) to give you ideas, but I always prefer that people give to a charity they care about. If you would like to pay me directly instead of or in addition to that, I've written up some pricing information that I can direct you to.

## how to order

Contact me via any of the options linked on this site. Let me know what you're interested in getting (in as much detail as possible please!) and a mailing address.

### can I order multiples?

yes! please do so within reason.

## shipping

I ship via USPS to the United States. International shipping is absolutely doable, but will be more expensive unfortunately.

I will get your item(s) into the mail when I can. No promises on speed, especially for made-on-demand items.
## customization and custom orders

### ex libris or logo stamps

I can create simple designs or recreate existing ones.

### patches and prints

I will take print/patch commissions if I am interested in the subject material.

Here's some representations of the ink colors I have:
